# genz-spec-extract
The genz-spec-extract project contains a single tool, which takes as
input the Gen-Z Core Specification's Microsoft Word and Visio files,
extracts relevant Gen-Z control structure and packet formats, and
produces a resulting XML file. That XML file is then fed into other
tools, such as the hpe-genz-xml-parser to automatically produce source code,
or to use as input for hardware design checking.
